<p>Hiya! So, I heard you like cheese! What? You don't?! Do you have some sort of lactose intolerance?!
Well, despite your sentiment towards cheese, I'm sure you'll find this informative, yet funny site on cheese
really gouda!

<p>I'll be talking about the four major groups of cheese; soft, semi-soft, medium-hard and semi-hard/hard.
These groups are determined by its moisture content which depends on the pressure with which it is packed into 
moulds and the amount of time it has aged for. Harder packing and longer aging means harder cheese.
Although there are several different ways to sort the groups of cheese, I think this is the best. 
I'll be giving various examples of cheeses within each type and highlighting some of favorites as well. 
But before you go anywhere, did you want to hear a pizza joke? You do? Nah, it's too cheesey.
