<h1>Medium-hard Cheeses</h1>
<p>Ah, now we've come to the group of cheese which has my all-time favorite cheese, Gouda! Medium-hard cheeses have a
wide range of textures too. They're ideal for melting and often served on toast as snacks or in sandwiches.

<h2>Gouda</h2>
<p>Gouda, despite the pun that I made earlier, is pronounced "How-da" by the Dutch in the city of Gouda in the
Netherlands where it was named after. One of the most popular cheeses and my favorite cheese, accounting for 50 to 60
percent of the world's cheese consumption. 
I mainly put it in my sandwiches for lunch but it can be used for melting, charcuterie and even as a dessert cheese. 
It has such a uniquely creamy flavour which is one of the reasons it is the best cheese.

<h2>Provolone</h2>
<p>Our first italian cheese on this site! I find the taste to be very similar to Havarti and I also put this cheese on
my sandwiches. It contains high amounts of calcium and protein, which is a good thing! But it's quite high
in sodium too, which is a bad thing. Have you heard about the cheese with no friends? They were Provolone... Picture shown below.
