<h1>Semi-hard/hard Cheeses</h1>
<p>Hard cheeses have a very low moisture content compared to soft cheeses. They are packed into moulds under high 
pressure and aged much longer than softer cheeses too. There were a lot of good examples to choose from 
but I think my favorites are Cheddar and Monterey Jack.

<h2>Cheddar</h2>
<p>Back in the olden days, England was the only place where Cheddar cheeses were made, but now it's famous worldwide!
Although, real cheddar cheese might not be as famous as you think. Cheddar cheese does not have a PDO, or 
protected designation of origin. That means cheeses labelled cheddar may vary a lot in terms of style and quality to 
real cheedar cheese. Real cheddar cheese has a creamy and very sharp taste. Joseph Harding, the "father of Cheddar
cheese", described the ideal quality of cheddar cheese to be "close and firm in texture, mellow in character or quality, 
rich with a tendency to melt in the mouth and has full and fine flavour somewhat like hazelnut!". Picture shown below.

<h2>Monterey Jack</h2>
<p>An american cheese that I yet again use in my sandwiches. Very similar tasting to cheddar cheese and melts really well. 
An all around good cheese. One could say that it's the Jack of all cheeses. Haha! Picture shown below.
