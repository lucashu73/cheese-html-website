<center><h1>Semi-soft Cheeses</h1></center>
<p>These cheeses aren't hard, but they're not that soft either. They have a high moisture content and usually have
a mild-taste. Well-known varieties include Havarti, Muenster and Port Salut.

<h2>Havarti</h2>
<p>One of my favorite cheeses to put on sandwiches and Denmark's most famous cheese. A truly delicious, mild and 
creamy semi-soft cheese! Available with various different flavours, my favorite is Jalapeno Havarti. Picture shown on left.
</p>

<h2>Muenster</h2>
<p>This one sort of rides on the line between soft and semi-soft cheese. I have to admit that I've only used this
cheese once to make macaroni. But it was delicious! A savory and sharp taste, best served in dishes such as; 
grilled sandwiches, macaroni and cheese, pizza and cheeseburgers. I once had a dream of this hideous amalgamation 
of cheese, it must've been a Muenster! And yes, it's pronounced like mun-ster. Picture shown in middle.
</p>

<h2>Port Salut</h2>
<p>Yet again another French cheese. I have also not tried this one yet and don't have much to say about it. I do know
that it's one of those cheeses served with crackers and meats on those charcuterie boards. So, it's probably too 
fancy for me anyways. I mean...even the name sounds fancy. Picture shown on right.
