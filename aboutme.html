Hello, my name is Lucas Hu. Here's a joke for you:
</p>

Knock, knock.<br>
Who's there?<br>
Lucas.<br>
Lucas who?<br>
Haha, that's me!<br>

<p>
Wasn't that such a good joke? I like jokes, as you can tell.
There's really not much to tell about me. I was born in Vancouver.
I'm currently 15 years old turning 16 in November. I'm in the
French Immersion Program at Kits and I've been in French
Immersion since Kindergarten. Something interesting is despite
me being 75% Chinese, I don't speak any dialects of Chinese.
Cool, I know right? Just English and French.
</p>

As far as my interests go, I like video games, reading and drawing
sometimes and playing the piano even though I'm really bad at
it. Something that I really like right now is "Doki Doki
Literature Club". Have you heard about it? It's a really good
game that's free on Steam. It might look like a normal game
but it gets really cool. I can't wait for the sequel of the
game that's probably going to be created maybe sometime in 2019.
Anyways, I think that's all that's on my mind right now.

Thanks for reading!

Here's what the game sort of looks like. Trust me it's not what
it seems like.

Here is the site where you can get the game: <a href="https://ddlc.moe" target="_blank">Doki Doki Literature Club </a>
