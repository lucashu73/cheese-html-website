<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li>3 large russet potatoes, scrubbed</li>
<li>3 tablespoons  olive oil</li>
<li>1 &frac12; teaspoons  salt, divided</li>
<li>1 teaspoon  pepper, divided</li>
<li>6 tablespoons  unsalted butter, 3/4 stick</li>
<li>&frac14; cup  all-purpose flour (30 g)</li>
<li>2 &frac12; cups  beef stock (600 mL)</li>
<li>2 teaspoons worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>3 tablespoons  cornstarch</li>
<li>2 tablespoons  water</li>
<li>1 &frac12; cups  cheese curd (335 g)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 450&deg;F (230&deg;C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
<li>On a cutting board, slice the potatoes into matchsticks by quartering lengthwise. Cut the quarters lengthwise into &frac14;-inch slices, then cut into &frac14;-inch (6 mm) matchsticks.</li>
<li>Place the potatoes in a large bowl. Drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of salt and &frac12; teaspoon of pepper. Toss to coat.</li>
<li>Arrange the fries evenly in 2 rows on each baking sheet so they are not touching.</li>
<li>Bake for 25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown.</li>
<li>In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the butter and flour. Whisk until the mixture is a golden brown. Add the beef stock, Worcestershire, remaining &frac12; teaspoon of salt and remaining &frac12; teaspoon of pepper. Bring to a boil, whisking continuously.</li>
<li>Add the water to the cornstarch in a small bowl and mix until dissolved. Add the cornstarch slurry to the gravy and stir until thickened. Remove from the heat and cover to keep the gravy hot.</li>
<li>Transfer the baked fries to a large bowl, add the cheese curds, and pour the hot gravy over the top. Toss to coat.</li>
<li>Transfer to a dish and serve immediately.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
