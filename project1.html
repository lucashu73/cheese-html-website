<center><h1>Soft Cheeses</h1></center>
<p>Soft cheeses are cheeses matured the least amount of time. Some of them aren't even matured, like cream cheeses.
The most these soft cheeses are matured is only about a month. Two notable examples of this group of cheese are 
Brie and Camembert.

<h2>Brie</h2>
<p>I'll keep this description on brie brie-f. Nicknamed "The Queen of Cheeses", Brie is the most well known French cheese
and one of the best dessert cheeses. It packs a fruity, nutty and tangy yet mild taste and only matured for around a month. 
Named after the Frenh region, Brie, where it was created. This cheese was used to pay tribute to the French 
kings hundreds of years ago and it is stilled consumed to this day. Picture shown below.

<h2>Camembert</h2>
<p>
I camembert living a life without Camembert (pronounced like cam-im-bear)! Well, that's sort of a lie because 
I've never tried Camembert, but it sounds and looks delicious. A buttery, milky, sweet and creamy taste and also only matured 
for around a month. Apparently, best served with a light red wine. I can't talk about it that much since I've 
never tried it though. Picture shown below.
